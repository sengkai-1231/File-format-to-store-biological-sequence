# File-format-to-store-biological-sequence

Biological sequence file format shall be in simple and rich formats. Example of simple sequence file format is FASTA file format while example of rich sequence file format is Genbank file format. Simple sequence file only shows the general desciption and sequence data, without any additional features and annotations. For rich sequence file, it combines all the details description of the biological sequences,sequence data, features, annotations, taxonomic information and bibliographic references related to the sequence.

By using C++ programming language, an application is developed to store and display the sequence file in different type of format by user either in FASTA file format(Simple format) or GenBank file format (Rich format). The application is developed using the object-oriented programming style.
